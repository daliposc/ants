change ants to bees
you play as the queen bee
and you program the hive
your goal is to collect Pollen
from many diffferent flowers
or other fauna
each with different merits 
the game cycle is Seasonal
fall, winter, summer, etc
and each present unique challenges
but the basic game loop is: explore the space, find new locations, plant or gather, and go to the next day
maybe each room has a type to it?
is this a forest room? a scary room? a loving room? a dense forest room?
but where do you find pollen?
you can either steal honey from the humans OR gather from the flowers
OR (and this is wild!) somehow force or encourage the humans to plant plants thus creating more opportunities for gathering pollen
