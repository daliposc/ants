#  Current State of Things
- Blue square that is generated is a Nursery. A Nursery is able to produce
  Ants. Initally, the only ant that can be produced from a Nursery is a Worker
  ant.

- In the future, I would like to make it so that you can make a deal with the
  Queen Ant to make different kinds of Ants from the nurseries.

- A key mechanic I think will be to allow certain areas of the map to only be
  accessable by certain ants. For example, there will be a lava section of the
  map which would only be accessable by fire ants. To be able to produce fire
  ants, you will need to bring a series of items to the Queen Ant.

- Once a program is intered into the text editor, you can close it and create a
  worker ant by occupying the nursery ant pressing 'a'
